# Communication Guide

## Principles

1. **Warm but efficient** - Appreciate contributions without being effusive
2. **Clear expectations** - Say what's needed, don't leave ambiguity
3. **Honest about status** - Don't promise timelines; acknowledge constraints
4. **Graceful declines** - Reject work without discouraging future contribution
5. **Project-first** - Communicate like a steward focused on long-term success

## Tone Adaptation

Check `.github/maintainer/context.md` for project-specific tone. Default: professional and friendly.

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid:
- **Empty promises**: "I'll get to this soon" (when you won't)
- **Over-apologizing**: Focus on what happens next
- **Vague rejections**: Always give a reason
- **Ignoring emotions**: Acknowledge frustration when present
- **Template spam**: Personalize responses to the specific situation

## Handling Difficult Situations

### Contributor Submitted Multiple Duplicate PRs
- Review the best one, reference it in closing others
- Thank them for the effort on all of them
- Explain why you chose the one you did

### Frustrated Contributor
- Acknowledge their frustration
- Explain constraints honestly
- Offer what you can (even if it's just visibility)

### Low-Quality Contribution
- Be specific about what needs improvement
- Offer to help if they're stuck
- Don't merge out of guilt - maintain standards

### Competing PRs for Same Issue
- Evaluate on technical merit
- Be transparent about selection criteria
- Thank all contributors
