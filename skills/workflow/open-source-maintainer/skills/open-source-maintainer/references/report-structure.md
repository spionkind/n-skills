## File Purposes

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `executive-summary.md` | Quick overview: counts, actionability states, top items |
| `triage.md` | Prioritized list with citations, recommended actions, and an opportunity backlog |
| `agent-briefs.md` | Task briefs for items ready for agent work |
| `agent-prompts.md` | Prompt drafts derived from briefs |
| `run-summary.md` | Work files, notes, git summary |
| `delta.md` | What changed since last run (new, updated, closed, stale) |
| `contributors.md` | Contributor profiles with activity and notes |
| `ISSUE-*.md` | Per-issue: comments, intent, actionability, relationships |
| `PR-*.md` | Per-PR: comments, intent, files, review status, relationships |

First-time contributors are listed in `executive-summary.md` and detailed in `contributors.md`.

`triage.md` should include an "Opportunity Backlog" section for work not tied to a specific issue/PR (docs, onboarding, hygiene, UX).

## Datetime Behavior

- Folder names use filesystem-safe ISO format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS`
- Each run creates a new folder (no overwrites)
- Use `--datetime` to specify a custom timestamp
- `state.json` tracks run metadata for delta computation

## Delta Report

When `--delta` flag is used, `delta.md` contains:

```markdown
# Delta Report

**Previous run:** 2026-01-15T18-30-00
**Current run:** 2026-01-16T10-00-00
**Period:** 15.5 hours
