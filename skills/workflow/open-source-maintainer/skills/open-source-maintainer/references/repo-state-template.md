## patterns.md

```markdown
# Observed Patterns

## Recurring Issues

### Windows Path Handling
- **First seen:** 2025-12-15
- **Frequency:** 8 duplicate reports
- **Root cause:** Hardcoded `/` instead of `path.sep`
- **Resolution:** Fixed in v1.3.1
- **Prevention:** Added Windows CI

### Version Display Mismatch
- **First seen:** 2025-12-19
- **Cause:** Hardcoded version string not updated
- **Resolution:** Read from package.json dynamically

## Contributor Patterns

- Chinese-speaking user base is significant (consider i18n)
- Contributors often submit multiple PRs for same issue (need faster review)

## Codebase Patterns

- Most bugs cluster in `src/cli/` (needs refactoring)
- Test coverage gaps in error handling paths
```

## standing-rules.md

```markdown
# Standing Rules

## Stale Policy

| Condition | Days | Action |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Issue waiting on reporter | 30 | Comment asking for update |
| Issue waiting on reporter | 60 | Close as stale |
| PR waiting on author | 30 | Close as stale |

## Auto-Labels

| Condition | Label |
|-----------|-------|
| PR touches `src/core/` | `core` |
| Issue mentions "windows" | `platform:windows` |
| First-time contributor | `first-contribution` |

## External PR Handling

- Never merge external PRs
- Extract intent and implement fixes directly
- Close PRs with explanation and credit
```

## state.json

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "lastRunAt": "2026-01-16T10:30:00Z",
  "lastReportDir": "reports/2026-01-16T10-30-00",
  "issueHashes": {
    "42": "abc123",
    "43": "def456"
  },
  "prHashes": {
    "38": "ghi789"
  }
}
```

The `*Hashes` fields store content hashes for detecting updates between runs.

## Initialization

When the skill detects no `.github/maintainer/` folder:

1. Create the directory structure
2. Copy templates from this file
3. Create `config.json` using the template (see `config.md`)
4. Prompt user to fill in `context.md` with project-specific information
5. Initialize `state.json` with empty state

The other files (`decisions.md`, `contributors.md`, `patterns.md`) start nearly empty and grow over time as the agent records observations.
